The relevant outputs are:

activities = dataframe containing the activities observed
features = a dataframe containing the descriptive names and their indexes of each variable measured from the raw data
features_list = a vector containing the descriptive names of each relevant variable used to clean the data
total_set = dataframe that contains all the mean and standard deviations measurements from the training and testing data)
  > the names of each variable are disposed in column names
  > the id column contains the number of the subject and the respective activity for the measurement
tidy_set = dataframe that contains the average of the all relevant measurements for each subject-activity pair
  > the id column from the total_set is now disposed as row names
